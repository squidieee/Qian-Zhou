## About

I'm a PhD candidate in the [Human Communication Technologies Lab](https://hct.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. My research lies at the intersection of VR/AR and Human Computer Interaction. I'm passionate about applying Computer Vision techniques to prototype 3D interactions and projector-based 3D displays. 
My PhD work focused on a special type of VR technology, callled [Fish Tank VR display](http://hct.ece.ubc.ca/project-3/), which is a fish-tank sized volumetric 3D display. I also worked as a Research Intern in Facebook Reality Labs on Tangible Interface with VR/AR HMD.
