I'm a Research Scientist in the HCI & Vis group at [Autodesk Research](https://www.autodesk.com/research). Before joining Autodesk, I completed my PhD in the [Human Communication Technologies Lab](https://hct.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. My research interest includes VR/AR, Human Computer Interaction and visual perception. I'm passionate about applying Computer Vision techniques to prototype 3D interactions and projector-based 3D displays. 
My PhD work focused on a special type of VR technology, callled [Fish Tank VR display](Projects.html), which is a fish-tank sized volumetric 3D display. I also worked on Tangible Interface with VR/AR HMD as a Research Intern in Facebook Reality Labs.
