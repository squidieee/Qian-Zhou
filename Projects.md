Crystal: a spherical Fish Tank VR display {#crystal}
========

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/crystal.PNG"> 

Crystal is an interactive spherical 3D display based on fish tank VR that uses stereo and head-coupled virtual reality on high-resolution desktop displays. Our new class of fish tank VR display technology uses the spherical shape to create a contained virtual reality volume. It allows visualization and interaction with 360 degrees of visibility.  We investigated the perceptual factors focusing on depth perception in the virtual environment. Prototypes of Crystal have been demonstrated in several conferences such as SIGCHI and IEEE VR.

# CoGlobe: a co-located multi-person Fish Tank VR experience


<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/coglobe.png"> 

We expanded the design of [Crystal](#crystal) to supports multiple people co-located in a shared space working and playing together through two different multiplayer games and tasks. Additional viewers can also watch using a variation of mixed reality with a tracked mobile smartphone. Using a smartphone as a second screen registered to the same virtual world enables multiple people to interact together. Prototype of CoGlobe has been demonstrated during 2018 Siggraph Emerging Technologies

# Gripmark: Transform Hand Grips into Tangible Input in MR

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/grip.jpg"> 

Gripmarks is a system that enables users to opportunistically use objects they are already holding as input surfaces for mixed reality head-mounted displays (HMD). Leveraging handheld objects reduces the need for users to free up their hands or acquire a controller to interact with their HMD. Gripmarks associate a particular hand grip with the shape primitive of the physical object without the need of object recognition or instrumenting the object. From the grip pose and shape primitive we can infer the surface of the object. We explore two categories of input objects 1) tangible surfaces and 2) tangible tools with representative applications.

# Automatic Calibration of Multiple-projector Display System

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/calib.PNG"> 

Modeling the projector as an inverse camera, we estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic projector parameters automatically using a set of projected images. A single camera is placed beneath to observe partially visible projected patterns. Using the correspondence between the observed pattern and the projected pattern, we reconstruct the shape of the spherical display and finally recover the 3D position of each  pixel on the display. We demonstrate our automatic approach can achieve an on-surface point mismatch less than 1mm and line mismatch less than 1 degree on a 30 cm diameter spherical screen. The calibration approach is accurate for a desktop 3D display and can be applied to other multiple-projector displays with vairous shapes of screens.

# I Got Your Point: Perceiving Pointing Gesture in the Virtual Environment 

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/pointing.png"> 

We designed and evaluated an intelligent virtual agent (IVA) that can point to some location in reality as accurately as a real person. We conducted studies to assess different pointing gestures and compared the performance with real person pointing in reality. Our IVA design mitigated the known ambiguity due to the eye-fingertip alignment commonly found in human pointing and provided design strategies for visual representations of IVA's pointing gestures.

# Realistic Eye Contact in the Virtual Environment 

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/eyecontact.PNG"> 

We describe the design, implementation and initial evaluation of a spherical Fish Tank Virtual Reality (FTVR) display for realistic eye-contact. We identify display shape, size, and depth cues as well as model fidelity as important considerations and challenges for setting up realistic eye-contact and package it into a reproducible framework.
