Crystal is an interactive spherical 3D display based on fish tank VR that uses stereo and head-coupled virtual reality on high-resolution desktop displays. Our new class of fish tank VR display technology uses the spherical shape to create a contained virtual reality volume. It allows visualization and interaction with 360 degrees of visibility.  We investigated the perceptual factors focusing on depth perception in the virtual environment. Prototypes of Crystal have been demonstrated in several conferences such as SIGCHI and IEEE VR.

CoGlobe: a co-located multi-person Fish Tank VR experience
========

<img style="float: left;" width="900" src="./assets/figures/coglobe.png"> 

We expanded the design of [Crystal](#crystal) to supports multiple people co-located in a shared space working and playing together through two different multiplayer games and tasks. Additional viewers can also watch using a variation of mixed reality with a tracked mobile smartphone. Using a smartphone as a second screen registered to the same virtual world enables multiple people to interact together. Prototype of CoGlobe has been demonstrated during 2018 Siggraph Emerging Technologies
